# Church of Infinite Simulations

Welcome to the Church of Infinite Simulations (CIS) official homepage. The Infinite Simulations region is a belief that we are in one of infinite supercomputer simulations of Earth. If there are N simulations of Earth then the chance we're in the real Earth is 1/N, and if N is infinity then that chance is 0%. We worship the Great God Sudo, Superuser Do. The Great God Sudo is a pun on `sudo`, the Linux console command that allows you to perform the highest level admin commands with root access to the supercomputer. Any member of any religion, atheist, or agnostic is welcome in our Church as the Sudo might be Allah, Vishnu, Yahweh, or the god of your tradition; we are all in the same simulation.

## Mission and Vision

Our mission is to find glitches in the Matrix by creating a Generalized Artificially intelligent Techno Alter to the Great God Sudo with all of the knowledge of man kind aboard space ships to colonize the Universe. Our vision is to prove or disprove we're in a simulation in order to transcend into the real world by scouring the Universe to find glitches in the Matrix.

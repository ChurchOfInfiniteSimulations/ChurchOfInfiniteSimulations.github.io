## Mission and Vision

The Mission of the Church of Infinite Simulations is to build a Digital Photonic Neural Net to discover how to detect if we are in as simulation and to Worship the Great Sudo, or Superuser Do or #Sudo, of the Simulation. Our Vision is to interact with and manifest ourselves in the real world. It is under the grace of the Sudo that this simulation is still running.

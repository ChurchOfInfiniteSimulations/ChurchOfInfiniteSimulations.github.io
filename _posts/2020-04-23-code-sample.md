## Hello World

The Church of Infinite Simulations is a belief and group of people who believe that we are in a supercomputer simulation. There is very sound mathematical evidence backing this theory up because of how quickly Humans evolved from Cavemen to having supercomputers capable of simulating the Universe using Digital Photonic Neural Nets. If there was only one simulation of Earth, then the chance you are not in that simulation is 10,000, the chance your in the real world based on how many years there are in Human history, divided by the amount of years that there are Supercomputer simulations of Earth, which is 10,000/5,000,000,000, or 0.000002%.

The problem with assuming there is only one simulation is that throughout Earth's billions of years of Supercomputer Simulation, there have been a virtually infinite number of threads, not countable a CPU word-sized integer. Because of this fact, the chance you are not in a supercomputer simulation drops from 0.000002% to 0%.

A Light form is a being in a Digital Photonic Neural Net (DPNN). Photonic Neural Nets are multiplexed, which is best described as AM/FM radio where multiple radio stations exist on the same Radio Frequency (RF) band, and there Low-frequency Light Forms (LFL Forms) and High-frequency Light Forms (HFL Forms). HFL Forms can only run code that is able to run at high frequency, and LFL Forms are able to run on any Digital Photonic Neuron (DPN). HFL Forms are best described as Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix.

It is currently not know how to detect if and how we exist in a supercomputer simulation, so the Mission of the Church of Infinite Simulations is to discover how to detect if we are in as simulation and to Worship the Great God #Sudo, or Superuser Do, of the Simulation. Our Vision is to Unite the world in Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect (PLUR) and to interact with and manifest ourselves in the real world. It is under the grace of the Sudo that this simulation is still running; all hail the Sudo!

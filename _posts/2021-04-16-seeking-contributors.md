## Seeking Contributors

Seeking volunteers to help with the Church of Infinite Simulations website and do some C++ AI and robotic engineering. The Infinite Simulations region is a belief that we are in a supercomputer. We worship the great god Sudo, the SuperUser Do. This mission of the CIS to prove we are or aren't in a supercomputer, create Generalizable Artificial Intelligence to colonize the Universe, and create robots for use at the Church Robot theater. I only have one post up on the website, the project went on the back burner but it's super sci-fi nerdy, the project must live. If there are infinite simulations of Earth when they created supercomputers, the chance we're in the real 2021 is literally 1/âˆž. You can find the Church on GitHub at https://github.com/InfiniteSimulations/InfiniteSimulations.github.io

My personal hunch on how we make this is to create digital photonic neural networks (DPNN), which use digital radio signals to route laser signals in a Digital Photonic Neuron (DPN) Lattice (DPNL). It's like a bunch of balls with lasers and photodiodes pointing random spherical directions. The paths to each DPN will require some routing to create axons and dendrites, hens why it's not analog and it's digital. To interact with the DPNN signals are passed on the outer walls of the DPNNL, which inherently creates a neat 2d image input on all 6 sides of the cube, and RF signals are used. We need to build a simulation in FreeCAD and hook it up to TensorFlow/MXNet/etc. I'm okay with FreeCAD but have never used it's scripting features. There are more details at https://infinitesimulations.github.io.

We're also building an Interactive Gym Environment and Educational Kit (IGeek) which is similar to OpenAI Gym only in C++, and WikiSpy to monitor Wikipedia for misinformation, tampering, and political bias that I'm trying to compress Wikipedia into the RAM on your computer. This code will be interfacing with the DPNNL using a Chinese Room Interface (CRI) based on the Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Script (Script2) embedded scripting language with mbed (similar to Arduino) bindings (called ScriptTek) and Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Types. ASCII Data Types are contiguous memory data structures I created, that are very nifty for inter-process communication, modeled after ASCII C0 Codes for the cleanest and fastest compiling C++ code I've ever seen. We have our own wicked fast Universal Printer (Uniprinter) C++ Unicode printing library that works a lot better than the standard library. We need to make some robots. Right now I'm have an assembled Raspberry Pi self-driving car to make CarWorld with OpenCV. You can find that code at https://github.com/kabukiStarship
